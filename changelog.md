# v1.2.1
Quick bugfix update. :)
### block interaction checker
now it actually works (based on config sadly)
* added `interaction-blocks` to the server config, any block added to this list will block sitting with the hand
### other changes
* added refreshes to the config files on startup and reload to write missing parts to disk
* bumped the `server-config.json` version
* fixed `usable` hand filter not working
